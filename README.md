# Diabetes and Chronic Disease Awareness in Jonnada

This project is based on an 8-week community survey conducted in Jonnada village to understand and address diabetes and other chronic diseases. As a team of non-medical students, we collaborated with healthcare professionals to gather insights, identify risk factors, and propose solutions to improve health outcomes.

## Key Focus Areas:

- **Understanding Diabetes and Chronic Diseases**
  - Introduction to diabetes, its stages, and chronic diseases like arthritis.
  
- **Blood Sampling and Health Analysis**
  - Conducted blood sampling to assess the prevalence of diabetes among villagers.
  
- **Identifying Key Risk Factors**
  - Discovered factors like poor diet, lack of awareness, and lifestyle habits contributing to diabetes.

- **App Development: Diabeaters**
  - Created the "Diabeaters" app to help villagers monitor food intake, exercise, and track their health status (safe, danger, or normal).

- **Community Awareness Campaigns**
  - Raised awareness through local WhatsApp groups and social media to educate villagers about diabetes prevention.

## Project Outcome:

Through this project, we developed practical solutions such as the "Diabeaters" app, which provides personalized health insights to help combat diabetes and other chronic diseases within the Jonnada community.
